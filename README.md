## Database Requirements

Create tables for:
- **users**: Store student and lecturer accounts
- **classes**: Course information and schedules
- **enrollments**: Link students to classes
- **attendance**: Track student attendance

## Technical Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+
- Secure coding practices (prevent SQL injection, XSS)
- Session-based authentication
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

1. Set up your local server (XAMPP/WAMP)
2. Create the database using `database/dcma_template.sql`
3. Configure database connection in `config/config.php`
4. Start building features incrementally
5. Test thoroughly with different user roles

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on:
- **Functionality**: All features work as expected
- **Code Quality**: Clean, organized, well-commented code
- **Security**: Proper input validation and sanitization
- **UI/UX**: Professional, user-friendly interface
- **Database Design**: Normalized, efficient schema
- **Documentation**: Clear README and code comments

## Tips for Success

1. Start with the database schema - get it right first
2. Build authentication before other features
3. Test each feature thoroughly before moving on
4. Use prepared statements or proper escaping for SQL
5. Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
6. Comment your code for clarity
7. Handle errors gracefully
8. Make the UI intuitive and attractive

## Demo Credentials (After Implementation)

You should create these test accounts:
- Lecturer: john_lecturer / password123
- Student: alice_student / password123
